The project is built using redux, redux-toolkit and tailwind.

To get started:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: To simulate the real time messages triggered by the server, I've hooked up an API call to the orange button at the bottom right of the Feed page.

To run the e2e tests:

```
npx playwright install
npm run e2e
or
npm run e2e:ui  (to view the tests as they're running)
```

To run unit / component tests:

```
npm run test
```
